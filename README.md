==============

Do you have no idea what "a stick of butter" is, or how to measure "a
cup plus two tablespoons"? This browser add-on provides a button that when
pressed, annotates US cooking units with their metric equivalent,
while also trying to convert from volumes to weights, such that you
can simply use your kitchen scale. Examples, where the part in []
would be added by this add-on:

* I used about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup [60–80 ml]
* 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed light-brown sugar [190 g]
* 1 1/2 sticks chilled unsalted butter [175 g]
* a tablespoon of heavy cream [15 g]
* 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano [65 g]
* sides about 2 1/2 to 3 inches [6.5–7.5 cm] high
* ¾ cup plus 2 Tbs sugar [175 g]
* mandoline set to 1/16th of an inch [2 mm].
* a 5- to 6-quart [4.75–5.75 l] heavy pot
* between 12 ounces and a pound [350–450 g]
* at about 350-380 degrees (F) [175–195 °C]
* Butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch [32.5×22.5×5 cm] baking pan
